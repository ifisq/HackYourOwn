        Due to COVID-19, tens of thousands of Computer Science internships have
        been canceled, leaving students stranded. While many have turned to
        developing their own projects to fill the void, self-study lacks a few
        crucial components of the internship experience - mentoring and feedback
        from professionals. Hack Your Own aims to add this extra dimension. By
        participating, you'll join a community of like-minded peers to design
        and build high-impact open source projects while receiving mentorship
        and guidance from experienced developers. Think of it as an intensive
        summer senior design course supported by industry advisors.

        We are welcoming CS students and early-career professionals interested
        in developing their skills by scoping, building and refining original
        open source projects during a time where there is a critical gap in
        internship opportunities. Our mission is to vet and connect high-quality
        emerging tech talent through a team-based, three month intensive program
        that provides peer-learning, professional development, mentorships and
        smartly-scoped projects.
